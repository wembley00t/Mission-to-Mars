# Mission-to-Mars

The purpose of this project is to update a current web app to include images of the all four of the hemispheres for Mars.
BeautifulSoup and Splinter were used to scrape the full resolution images of Mars' hemispheres and the titles for the 
images.  The scraped data was stored on a Mongo database and a web application was used to display the data.

A sample of the updated webpage is below.  The updated webpage includes the hemispheres for Mars as a thumbnail.  The 
header has an updated background color.  The button language has been updated to "Click Here" and the title for the Mars 
Facts table has been centered.
